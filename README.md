# Datastructure and algorithms

## 1) Introduction
in this documentation, we will be exploring how to implement certain algorithms, test them and evaluate the result. for a more detailed overview of the assignment, we have thaken the liberty and attached it as a appendix to this document.



## Implementation of a binary search tree (BVS)

In the following, we will be looking into how to implement a binary search tree via python. As a starting note, this will be the first time im implementing a algorithm such as this. 

We will be using the tutorial found on https://algorithmtutor.com/ as the basis for the implementation.
